Digital Product Management Homework 7

This assignment taught me how to create a survey within an html file for users to particiapte in.

My web conforms to best practices because it asks questions about specific lifestyle questions that many undergraduate students interact with. It collects data about personal items from peoples perspectives while they are a student here at the University of Iowa.

On my assignment I also asked the participatants their gender and made sure there were inclusive options. I made a drop down list with different gender's an individual could identify as and listed it in my index.html file. I took the list from the University of Iowa and complied with their expectations.

I also made sure my website passed the WCAG 2.1 AA level. It took me a few tries to find the right color that meet this requirement. Making sure your website is accessible is important for all users to use and understand.

Overall this assignment really helped me understand how to be more inclusive to users and to also practice my html coding skills within visual studio code.
